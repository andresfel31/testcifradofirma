========================BUILD OUTPUT DESCRIPTION========================When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDEautomatically copies all of the JARfiles on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDEalso adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the applicationJAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder andtype the following:java -jar "CifradoFirmaPruebaTecnica.jar" To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)and distribute the ZIP file.Notes:* If two JAR files on the project classpath have the same name, only the firstJAR file is copied to the lib folder.* Only JAR files are copied to the lib folder.If the classpath contains other types of files or folders, these files (folders)are not copied.* If a library on the projects classpath also has a Class-Path elementspecified in the manifest,the content of the Class-Path element has to be onthe projects runtime path.* To set a main class in a standard Java project, right-click the project nodein the Projects window and choose Properties. Then click Run and enter theclass name in the Main Class field. Alternatively, you can manually type theclass name in the manifest Main-Class element.
